# Last-Mile Delivery Delay Prediction

This project predicts last-mile delivery delays using machine learning (Random Forest) and visualizes the results with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, LabelEncoder)
- Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier
- Power BI for dashboard and visualization

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights
- Trained a model on 1,000+ delivery records with features like distance, driver experience, and vehicle type
- Achieved 89.2% accuracy using Random Forest with encoded categorical features
- Created a Power BI dashboard with KPIs, confusion matrix, and slicers for operational analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Outcome
- Used classification metrics to evaluate performance
- Visualized model results and delivery trends across key logistics parameters
- Deliverable ready for analytics, SCM, or logistics-based roles
