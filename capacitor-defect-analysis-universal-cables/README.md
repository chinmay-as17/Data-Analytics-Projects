# Capacitor Defect Reduction â€“ Universal Cables Ltd.

ðŸŽ¯ **Project Goal**:  
To reduce manufacturing defects in the capacitor production line by analyzing rejection logs, identifying top defect causes, and implementing root-cause-based corrective actions.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Results:
- Analyzed 3 weeks of rejection logs from welding & sealing sections
- Identified 54% of defects from 2 processes using Pareto
- Improved first-pass yield by **18%** after RCA-based actions

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Excel (Pareto, Line Charts, RCA Matrix)
- Manual data logging
- Root Cause Analysis (Fishbone)
- Action Plan Sheet (Before/After Analysis)

---

## âœ… Outcome:
Project conducted during internship at **Universal Cables Ltd., Satna**  
Internship Duration: **3 weeks**  
Department: **Capacitor Manufacturing + Quality Control**

This project showcases data-driven problem solving on shopfloor defects using Excel and lean quality tools.
